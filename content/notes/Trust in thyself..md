You know better than anyone what your weak spots and failure modes are, under what conditions you do your best thinking, and what standards you seek to meet with your work. You also probably can feel it when a project is going the wrong direction. Maybe you're finally shipping something but you think it's the wrong thing. Maybe a client loves an idea but you think it won't succeed. "You know it when you see it" and when you see it, you should speak up. You should make a compelling case for what you believe to be right, and try to understand why the project or client has gravitated toward the decision in question. Above all, trust in your intuition.
