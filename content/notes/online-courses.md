After the first wave of massive online education pioneered by [[MOOCs]] and expanded by [[Course Marketplaces]] there remained a need for better skills-based education online.

Websites like [[Codeacdemy]] exemplify are typical of this range of products, featuring interactive or executable lessons wherein students learn through doing, and are incentivized through an interactive assessment system.

These courses added better incentive and retention systems over [[Course Marketplaces]] but still did not really address students' needs for participatory learning beyond forums for Q&A.

Independent creators and educators began creating their own [[Course Toolkits]] later on which began to replace both [[Course Marketplaces]] and Interactive Courses as the most promising means of making a living as a teacher online.
