This seems stupid to even say, but it's worth saying. Hone your communication skills to recognize the different forms of knowledge and working style collaborators bring to the table. Most clients will not understand the way we think, because we are specialists â€” and their teams will likely understand even less. Clients are specialists, too, in their vision and business (that's why we run strategy engagements). And their teams are probably editors, scientists, entrepreneurs, writers or artists, business heads, art directors, and more. Pay attention to how those people communicate and reason around ideas, and try to meet them halfway when collaborating.
