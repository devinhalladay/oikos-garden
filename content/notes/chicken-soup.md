> The things we design aren't intended for the world as it is. — [[Dunne and Raby]]

Critique is one of the most valuable aspects of design practice, education, and growth; it's also one of the most difficult, misunderstood, and under-practiced aspects. Whether you'd like to improve your work and presentation skills, support your colleagues, become a better collaborator, or even express a unique perspective on design itself — learning to think critically and give effective feedback will transform your design practice.

Fundamentally, critique implies a simple but radical idea: that by interrogating what we make today, we can design things that enable a better tomorrow. By its very nature, critique can and should be a collaborative effort, one focused on improvement, trust, and respect. But, all too often, we ignore, forget, or perhaps never even learn to consider, this idea.

This essay pulls together insights and tips from many perspectives on critical thinking and feedback in the design process. My hope is that it will help you, dear reader, think more deeply about the feedback process and the idea of design criticism. I'll break down some theory and context, different ways of thinking about the words "design criticism", and some tips and tricks to help you improve the way you give __and__ receive feedback.

# What is design criticism for, anyway?

> Design must be an innovative, highly creative, cross-disciplinary tool responsive to the needs of [people]. It must be more research-oriented, and we must stop defiling the earth itself with poorly-designed objects and structures. — [[Victor Papanek]], [[Design for the Real World]]

Okay, first thing's first: why talk about this at all? Let's take a look at critique from three perspectives: our work, our studio culture, and our broader cultural impact.
## Critique as studio practice: How we improve our work

Many of us have had bad experiences with critique, either in school or in the workplace. These bad experiences, I think, tend to cause designers to become disillusioned with the idea of critique. This applies especially to designers trained at a design school, where critique can become competitive or prescriptive. To make matters worse, sometimes in a design studio we are almost exclusively getting our feedback from our clients. This can make feedback feel transactional or inconsequential, and causes us to lose sight of the fact that **critique is a tool for growth and learning**.

[[Jacob Heftmann]] once mentioned that he feels that best design work is produced by studios that operate in the context of an art practice. When we look to art practice, we see a very active and engaged process of critique, not only of the progression and final execution of an artwork; but also of the progression of the artist's craft and ideas. This process is unique as compared to the way most people do design critique, because it not only serves to improve the work, but also to help the artist think in new ways, and to contribute to wider discourse around art itself.

Now, ask yourself: as a designer, how have you experienced critique in the past? Has critique been a deliberate, continued process that contributes to your skill, your thinking, your perspective? Or has it been more passive — always focusing on the next deliverable, or meeting client expectations, without actively challenging you to fundamentally improve?

I know my answer: my experience with critique has been passive and unorganized, isolated to the client revision process, and often without input from other design experts. Critique has seldom felt truly collaborative, actionable, and liberating. It just hasn't helped me grow as a designer in the way I'd like.

And that's exactly why design studios should think more deeply about critique as an active, deliberate part of their process. Active critique, and active improvement to the critique process, helps designers iterate and take action. It helps them grow and learn by seeing their work from an outside perspective, and gives them more agency by allowing them to decide how to integrate feedback into their work.

Different folks may want to get different things out of critique, which is another great reason to approach it more thoughtfully and holistically. Critique could be used to explore concepts in a brainstorm; finesse details before production; asking or discovering new questions; celebrating successes; learning new processes. It's a glorious buffet for designers who want to improve their thinking and work.

It's all too common to treat design critique as "passive feedback", where we're constantly bombarded by the next nitpick from a client, or only hearing feedback from our direct collaborators. If we choose, instead, to place emphasis on the value and style of critique as a studio, we create new opportunities to improve our work. We break that cycle of bad feedback, disillusionment, and burnout.
### Critique as social practice: How we improve each other

> Any design is a kind of education. — [[Victor Papanek]], [[Design for the Real World]]

In the previous section, I wrote that design critique can feel transactional, overwhelming, and even pointless. It can feel like feedback is only there to better serve the client. But design is a collaborative activity, one where lots of voices come together and mediate conflict, misalignment, challenges, and goals.

If design is a collaborative practice, shouldn't critique be, too?

Sure, the purpose of a critique is to improve our work so that our clients can be successful. We want to put our best foot forward. But critique, when we frame it as a foundational element of design practice, one that is highly collaborative, also serves to help us grow as individuals. And by strengthening individuals, it strengthens the team. Through improving our work, we improve: ourselves; our relationships; and our team's culture, process, and mentality.

Think of critique like a gift exchange. A gift exchange is a ritual defined, in particular, by a time and place chosen by its participants; maybe by a theme or shared occasion like a holiday; and by a shared desire to demonstrate tender understanding of one another.

By focusing on our framing and methods of critique, over time we learn how to become better gift givers, and how to more gracefully receive gifts from others. We improve our shared rituals and enhance our understanding of each other.

So, beyond the immediacy of improving our work to satisfy clients and fill a portfolio, critique is valuable as a social practice. It brings us together to elevate and challenge one another as experts, outsiders, and valued collaborators. Critique can be the foundation of a care-based, collaborative design practice.
### Critique as cultural practice: How we improve design

> Design, if it is to be ecologically responsible and socially responsive, must be revolutionary and radical. — [[Victor Papanek]], [[Design for the Real World]]

> Our role is changing to that of a facilitator who can bring the needs of the people to the attention of manufacturing, government agencies, and the like. The designer then logically becomes no more (and no less) then a tool in the hands of the people. — [[Victor Papanek]], [[Design for the Real World]]

Okay, so now we know how critique elevates our work, and pushes us to challenge and enrich each other's thinking. But there is one more facet of critique that many designer practitioners — including studios — choose to ignore, or maybe have not even been exposed to. This aspect is the cultural impact of critically thinking about, discussing, and challenging design.

Whether you've thought about it or not, it's easy to see that design is a cultural practice with tremendous influence over the world, over the way we interact with and view ourselves and each other. When we talk about "design criticism" we're not only speaking of feedback on pictures and prototypes; we're also implicating design itself in a historical discourse. We're talking about __how we talk about__ design, and about __how the way we talk about design__ affects our impact on the world.

"Design criticism" is not just part of the design process, it's also part of the design practice — as in, the history and impact of our entire discipline. Pick up any design history book and you'll probably find a through-line of academic discourse criticizing design itself, inspecting the things designers make, how they make them, and in turn, what the things we make do in the world.

In a studio, the most immediate value of critique is usually to improve our work and each other. But we can also look at criticism and feedback to improve our discipline at a systematic level. This kind of critique is a bit different from what I broke down in the first two sections:

* Critique as a cultural practice engages with not only our own work, but also with the work of other designers in our industry.
* Critique as a cultural practice engages not only with our own processes, assumptions, and impact, but also with those of all designers.
* Critique as a cultural practice "draws design into crisis" so as to define its internal logic, identify its fault lines, and improve it as a holistic cultural practice.

This view — that design criticism matters to culture itself — breaks the idea of feedback and critique out of the confines of an individual design practice. By opening ourselves to the idea that criticism as a cultural practice is part of our responsibility — perhaps even our ethical duty — as designers, we can begin to engage with the world in a new way. We can think "beyond the design process" and turn a critical eye toward other studios and practices, disciplines and processes, worldviews and cultural contexts.

To summarize:

* Through critique as a studio practice, we improve our work. This makes clients happy, can grow our business, and helps us improve and diversify our skills.
* Through critique as a social practice, we improve our relationships with each other, and our relationship with our work. This helps us develop trust, inter-reliance, and positive energy.
* Through critique as a cultural practice, we improve the way the design discipline talks about itself and relates to the world. This helps us produce better, more socially conscious, and in the end, more impactful designs and processes.

## Why should this matter to a studio?

Why start a studio? There are many answers. My deepest hope is that your answer is not "money" or "cachet." My deepest hope is that studio practices come together to express a point of view: a perspective on how design ought to be done, and what it ought to accomplish. When creative people come together to this way, magical things happen. At Manhattan Hydraulics, I think this perspective involves a keen focus on the importance of craft, relationships, labor, and social impact. At least, that's the way I see it.

When we think more deliberately, more conceptually, about the role of critique in a studio, we're refusing to tack the feedback process as a given, as a "readymade" process that comes free with every project, client, and collaborator.

By refusing to accept that assumption, we're practicing responsive, inclusive, and engaged communication and design work with peers. We're also learning to articulate our own methodologies for research and design within our presentations, discussions, and writing.

Further, because design critique is useful for driving iteration, skill growth, and learning, improving the way we give and receive feedback is essential to iterating, growing, and learning! Feedback is a skill; this is important to remember. Like any other skill, we can train to improve it — but to really improve and find critique impactful, we need to be active.

And finally, critique is for __everyone__ involved in the design process. Every discipline is welcome to give critique, as well as receive it, in a formal and thoughtful setting. Why should designers have all the fun? Go ahead: invite your strategist to solicit critique on their roadmap. Invite your developer for critique on their design interpretation. Invite your manger for critique on their org structure.

Critique, done right, builds a culture of exchange and mutual investment in each other. Effective critique builds morale, trust, and long-term selfless collaboration. And we can't build that culture without including everyone, without being attentive to our approach and framing, without treating critique as a fundamental aspect of what "design" is all about.
## What makes a good critique?

A good critique (in the sense of "critique as a studio practice") should result in a set of clear considerations that the designer, as an author, decides how to process and integrate their work. Critics should come away feeling like they've given a thoughtful gift, and the designer should feel free to do what they wish with that gift. If anyone feels entitled, hurt, unheard, or shut down: you're done something wrong. The designer is never obligated to act on critique, because part of what makes critique special is the way it helps us develop trust in each other and our design process.

Earlier, I mentioned that critique is like a gift exchange, or a ritual. Let's break that down a bit further. A ritual consists of:

#### A collectively decided-upon time and place

Critique should happen regularly, and in addition to ad-hoc feedback from clients and partners, there should be a more formal critique setting. This formal setting is a time and space we all agree to use to challenge each other's work. Because this is a ritual and an exchange, all participants — both critic and designer — should feel engaged, heard, confident, and clear.

#### A theme or shared occasion

A productive critique is grounded in the context of the work itself, and the thought process of the designer. Critics should focus on seeing through the eyes of the designer and their audience. One of the best ways to accomplish this is to define that context, a set of questions, and a goal — all elements that make up a great gift exchange.

#### A shared desire to understand and challenge one another

Critique should be approached with [[Radical Candor]] — a communication and feedback technique that focuses on being respectfully critical, honest, vulnerable. Critique is about understanding a designer's intent, in context, and drawing what you see into question from their perspective. It's not about the critics could/should/oughts, or design by committee. It's about amplifying the designer's authorial voice and helping them to better articulate it. We accomplish this by actively listening, asking good questions, and providing actionable feedback.

### How to receive critique with grace

As the designer, you're setting the table for the critics — initiating the ritual for your gift exchange. Getting a good critique means taking an active role in the process! Here are some tips and common practices to help you take a more active role, and solicit better feedback:

Invite the right people. Think about the goals for your critique, and invite only the people that will help you get there. This will help you feel like you're an active participant, and can eliminate a lot of off-topic feedback and opinionation.

Present problems, not solutions. In general, try to bring work that is somewhere from 25% to 75% complete. This is a rule Pixar brings to their daily critique sessions that proved very useful. Work that is less than 25% complete probably isn't figured out enough, and work over 75% complete is too far along for feedback to be impactful.

If possible, give people a sneak peek. Send out a short summary or Loom video so people can come to the session prepared to hear you out.

Acknowledge the intent of your work. Express your standpoint as the author, and share relevant context so that others can understand your logic.

Frame the critique with goals. What exactly do you want to take away from this critique? Are there specific questions you can ask to help get closer to these goals?

Avoid asking passive questions. These are questions like "what do you think?" or "does this make sense?". Instead, try asking active questions, like "does my intent come across in what you're seeing?" or "from a user's perspective, does this interaction feel natural?"

Respect your critics. Hang back and take time to collect your thoughts after they speak. After you've shared your intent and goals, create space for curiosity and critical questions. Set aside your ego and listen.

"Tell me more" is a powerful way to encourage spontaneous and honest feedback. When in doubt, let your critics wander. Let them not understand, let them be irrelevant, let them make sense for themselves. To "win" at critique is to get a few insights, ideas, or suggestions that you are excited about, or that you couldn't think up on your own. Lead the conversation until you get there. Listen intently.

Step into your role as an author. It's your role to decide what to do with feeback you get. A good chunk of it might not be important to you, or might not move the work forward in a meaningful way. That's ok, it's part of the process.  You are the author of your work, and critique is done in service of helping you improve your authorial skills. Just because someone told you something, doesn't mean you need to act on it.
### How to give critique with candor

Being a good critic is just as important of a skill as being a good designer. Sometimes it's actually more important, like when you're a manager or a strategist.

Lara Hogan gives us a really cool framework for giving consistently productive critique, in the form of an equation:

> Observation + Impact + Question or Request = Actionable Feedback

Let's break this down!

#### Observation

Start by simply stating your observations. What do you see in front of you? Your goal should be to help a designer understand whether their intent is effectively framed and communicated. Letting the designer know what you see, and what you understand, is a simple but powerful tactic. A critic will often see things differently than the creator, and this is some of the most valuable feedback we can give. By showing the designer what we __think__ they are trying to say or accomplish, they can begin to understand what their work is __actually__ saying.

#### Impact

This is where you can say how you feel. Remember how the designer shared their intent and goals at the beginning of the session? Tie what you see back to that intent, and describe whether you think what you see is successful in communicating that intent. And remember: it's important to recognize the context a designer is bringing to the table, and filter your feedback through it.

#### Question or Request

In general, there are two styles of feedback: questions and requests. It can take time to figure out which one best fits your personal style, and both can be valid.

Request-style feedback is when you share your observations, why it matters to you, and advice on how __you__ would do it instead. This is great for something like a brainstorm, but sometimes it's not productive. Remember that critique should be grounded in what you see and what the designer wants to discover; in many cases, it shouldn't be speculative or instructive, but concrete and relevant. Lots of designers default to requests — understandably, because this is how we most often hear feedback from clients. When in doubt, ask the designer if they're willing to hear your request, and let them decide based on their goals.

Question-style feedback is when you ask the designer specific questions to spur their curiosity. By asking questions instead of providing suggestions or instructions, we're drawing attention to points of contention, curiosity, and confusion. Sometimes critics try to use this style because they view the "Request" style as harsh or directorial, but it's important to know that this is also a skill that you can improve. Asking good questions is hard, but one good question can be better than all the suggestions in the world.

#### Actionable Feedback

Whether you've used a request or question style for your critique, your goal as a critic should be to give the designer something to act on! In the same way the designer created space for you to give feedback, an excellent critic should aim to create space for the designer to move forward and make informed decisions. If your feedback is prescriptive, instructional, heavy-handed, rude, out of context, or too speculative — the odds are that the designer didn't get what they needed out of the critique.

One tip is to ask the designer near the end of the review session: "Did you get what you needed out of this feedback?"

Beyond that equation, which is a great way to get started improving your critique skills, here are some more tips to guide you:

* Critique should be kind, but doesn't need to be nice. It's about [[Radical Candor]] — being very vulnerable with each other by drawing thoughtful, deliberate attention to areas where a person can improve their work. It's an act of compassion.

* In general, unless asked, try to avoid giving corrective critiques. Instead, focus on understanding the intent of the designer and give feedback through the lens of helping them better communicate that intent.

* When providing critique, try to share what you think is working with as much enthusiasm as you describe what isn’t working. Avoid the compliment sandwich; be clear, candid, and kind.

* Be cautious when raising objections.  An objection, like an instruction, is a very powerful form of feedback. An objection should be raised if something might put the business or client at risk, harm someone's health or safety, or conflict with the studio's values. If your objection doesn't hit those criteria, try rephrasing it as a question. Instead of "I think your solution is wrong because it reinforces negative behavior", try out "do you think this design encourages desirable behaviors?"

* Another way that you can improve your feedback is to depersonalize the feedback. The comments should always be about the work and context, never about the person who made it. It’s “This button isn’t well aligned” versus “You haven’t aligned this button well.” This is very easy to change and makes a big difference in creating a critique environment that feels safe.

* Try writing down your feedback and listening to others before vocalizing it. You may find that others share your perspective, or maybe feel differently. This can spur interesting insights for the designer! Better yet, if you bullet out your feedback, you can go a bit further and send that list to the designer afterward — recognizing that the designer may do what they wish with your feedback, including disregarding it.
