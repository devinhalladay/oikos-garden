Most designers don't either, and to be honest I'm not really sure I know what that shit means either. Remember, Design is a sense. and so is product thinking, which is maybe why it's so hard to define. It's lots a big messy ball of the many types of specialized intuitive reasoning you've learned through your life and work as a designer. This makes it really difficult to communicate certain ideas to clients — things like dynamic systems and feedback loops, or interaction patterns or technical constraints. Make it your goal to lower the barrier to entry to our way of thinking — clients will learn a lot, come to trust us more, and you will learn as well.
