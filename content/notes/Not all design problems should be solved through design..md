Problems give way to opportunities through the design process, but they don't have solutions per se. Product teams often look for "the thing" or "the answer" but the truth is those things are highly subjective. Rather than approaching product work as an attempt to reach a solution to the problem, approach it as an opportunity to explore a problem space and gain consensus on an optimal vision and implementation. Along the way, recognize and embrace compromises and constraints, and use intuition and data to back your decisions.

**Also, it's worth questioning the assumption that challenges framed through a design engagement have a design-driven solution**. It's not uncommon for a problem in your design work to be best solved through org design, a new process, the right question, an outside expert, etc. **You can't design your way out of every hole.**
