On most projects, feedback on our work is isolated to two parties: the client, and the ICs working on the project. This is bad for both the client and the ICs, as well as the work output, because feedback becomes messy, indirect, or sort of in-bred over time. You should be seeking feedback from people outside your project so that you can "take off your blinders" and the blinders the client may have on. Remember, their idea is their baby, so all their feedback should be filtered through that lens. Reach out to studiomates for a design review; convince your client to do user testing; put out a survey or call for feedback on Twitter. Do anything you can to diversify the voices that are informing your design decisions.
