Client work can be hard. Projects can get grueling. Sometimes you need a break, an infusion of new ideas and energy, advice or a listening ear, or just some positive affirmation that you are, in fact, doing your best and doing it well. When in doubt, turn to your team — they will support you as long as you ask. On the other hand, you should also be a person your team can rely on in the same way — you should proactively seek to aid your team members, lift their spirits, improve their work, or face a tough situation with a client. This build trust, and trust builds kindness, and kindness makes all storms easier to bear.
