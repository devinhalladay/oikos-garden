  <p>I've been lead designer at Cents since 2016, working alongside an all-star team to build a seamless product that just works. After many long nights of designing and testing, Cents recently launched to the public with a web app. Our iOS app is coming soon to the App Store.</p>
  <p>I'll update this project with the iOS portion as soon as the app launches!</p>
