  <h2>Leading the Way</h2>
  <p>I had the opportunity to lead a small team on designing and building the Quora Year in Review email that is sent out to every active Quora user at the end of each year.</p>
  <p>My role was end-to-end: developing the concept, designing the variations, building the front-end, and building bits and pieces of the backend functionality.</p>
  <p>I designed many different variations of the email, customized to different metrics touchpoints, so that each user's email would be as personalized as possible.</p>
