    Rather than subject the text of the books to algorithmic rules, I defined algorithmic rules that take various metrics from the text and use them as input to an abstract data vizualization. This brings the content of each book to life in a way similar to other books in the series, unifying them visually and conceptually.

  <p>Complete with facsimiles of layout design software functionality like intelligent text reflowing based on character width and a configuration interface, this book cover generator handles the hard parts of the design system beneath an easy to use interface.</p>
