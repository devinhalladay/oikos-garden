  <p>This piece was created in response to my readings of Donna Haraway and Byung-Chul Han. Its goal is to interrogate the space between organic-body and data-point by explicitly subjecting a user's emotions as read by a simplistic algorithm to the mechanics and imagery of capitalism and empirical data culture.</p>
  <p>The project was made with P5.js, using averaged data from <i><a href="https://ig.ft.com/how-much-is-your-personal-data-worth/">Financial Times</a></i> to generate a new "emotional cost" at a regular interval.</p>
