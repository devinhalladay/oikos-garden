This is some *markdown content*. The element below needs data from a page or static query, neither of which are possible in MDX components or MDX pages generated by gatsby-node.js

<NoteCard note={props.data.brainNote.note1} />

Here is some more Markdown __content__.

export const pageQuery = graphql`
  query {
    note1: brainNote(title: {eq: "Critique is chicken soup for the designer's soul"}) {
      id
      title
      childMdx {
        frontmatter {
          title
          tags
          date(formatString: "MM.DD.YYYY")
        }
      }
    }
  }
