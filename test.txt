They represent a general disposition in American society — a disposition saturated with an unquenchable thirst for efficiency and time. This thirst for efficiency and time is part of the general consciousness of America — so much so that even my father, when asked about the prospect of self-driving cars, stated that he would certainly use any time in the car to perform work, rather than do other things like read or relax.

Perhaps, as Waymo's stock photography and videos seem to promise, riders in self-driving cars will enjoy their ride by spending time with family, laughing, playing games, watching movies, and reading books. Perhaps. But I also suspect that eventually, once this novelty effect wears off, the mechanics of American workaholism will take over once more, as they always seem to do. People will grow tired of the novelty, and will become busy or find that they can get ahead in the workplace by performing work tasks in the car. Americans, after all, will do nearly anything to get ahead: this has been embedded in the spirit of our country since its creation.

Some people may choose to work more, some may choose to do other activities, and some may choose to simply sit and ride, making no changes from the way they spent their time when they were still driving. Now suppose that other technologies of automation and work assistance enter into this scenario. AI-powered personal assistants bring work emails, checklists, calendar events, and context-aware reminders to you instantly, anywhere you are — via phones, watches, glasses, speakers, and even via your car itself. Remember, for a moment, how difficult it already is to pry oneself away from one's work — it takes an immense degree of commitment and will power to ignore notifications in our hyper-attention-deficit society. When all these notifications and work reminders come directly to you wherever you are, imagine how difficult it will be to resist the urge to engage with them. So even if self-driving cars themselves do not directly affect work and productivity metrics, the technologies that develop in tandem certainly will.

Time and time again through the history of industry this has become evident: from child labor, to sweat shops, to mechanical automation, and even to economically-motivated biopolitical practices like health insurance, the primary objective of industry has been to eliminate as much of the human spirit as possible so as to push industry forward at an unfettered velocity. Automation and assistive work technologies are the next tool in capitalism's belt, and they will undoubtedly be used to their maximum effect to mine productivity, efficiency, and capital from workers in order to drive industry forward.
