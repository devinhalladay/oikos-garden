## About this site
In the past, this website served as something of a personal blog. As time went on, I found myself writing more passive notes and drawing relationships between source material, than actually penning essays. I wanted a place to store all those thoughts without the pressure of publishing a typical essay, so I created this wiki. On this site, you'll find essays, working notes, creative works, and other types of media, all linked together into a network. You can view the source code [here](https://github.com/devinhalladay/oikos-garden).
